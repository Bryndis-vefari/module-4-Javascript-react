#Javascript - React

For this asignment I followed a youtube tutuorial by Danascript, that helps you build a weather app. I found this appropriate as I am in a group that is going to be doing a weather app with a twist in the final project in this module. So I wanted to have an understanding of how weather apps use APIÂ´s. The video takes you through step by step how to build a weather app. I gave me some good ideas for our final project, so this was really helpful.
